                Yelagiri Hills, nestled in the Vellore district of Tamil Nadu, India, is a charming 
                hill station offering a serene retreat from the hustle and bustle of city life. 
                Situated at an altitude of around 1,110 meters above sea level, Yelagiri is known 
                for its pleasant weather, lush greenery, and breathtaking landscapes. The hills are 
                adorned with orchards, rose gardens, and winding roads that lead to mesmerizing 
                viewpoints. Punganur Lake, at the heart of Yelagiri, adds to the scenic beauty,
                providing opportunities for boating and relaxation. Adventure enthusiasts can 
                engage in activities like trekking and paragliding, while nature lovers can explore 
                Swamimalai Hills, the highest point in Yelagiri, for panoramic views. The simplicity 
                of the local culture and the warmth of the people make Yelagiri Hills a delightful 
                destination for those seeking a tranquil escape.
